## Paragraph:
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Use Character and Paragraph styles to save time and ensure consistent formatting throughout your artwork. A Character style is a collection of character formatting attributes that you can apply to a selected range of text. A Paragraph style includes both character and paragraph formatting attributes. You can apply it to a selected paragraph or a range of paragraphs.
## Line breakes:
This is the first line.<br>
And this is the second line.

# Discussion:
In Markdown, naming conventions are less about variable names and more about how you structure and format your text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text in a simple and readable way.

# 1. Experiment no: 02
# 2. Experiment Name:
Best Coding Practices
# 3. Objectives:
* Knowing what is naming convention and types of convention.
* Discussing common conventions like camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and kebab-case.
# 4. Source code and output:
# Naming Conventions:
there are mainly 4 types of naming conventions in industry:
- Camel Case.
- Snake Case.
- Kebab Case.
- Pascal Case.


### 1. **Camel Case** (`myVariableName`)

- **Best Use**: 
  - Variables and function names in JavaScript, Java, and many other languages.
  
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let userAge = 25;
  function calculateTotalPrice() {
      return price * quantity;
  }
- **Practice**:
  - Start with a lowercase letter.
  - Each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
  - Use descriptive, self-explanatory names (`calculateTotalPrice` instead of `calcTotal`).

### 2\. **Snake Case** (`my_variable_name`)
- **Best Use**: 
  - Variable and function names in Python and Ruby.
  - Constants in some languages like C.
- **Example**: 
    ```python 
    user_age = 25 def calculate_total_price(): return price * quantity

- **Practice**:
  - Use all lowercase letters. 
  - Separate words with underscores. 
  - Avoid overly long names, keep it concise but clear.

### 3\. **Kebab Case** (`my-variable-name`) 
- **Best Use**: 
  - CSS class names. 
  - URLs and configuration files like JSON or YAML. 
- **Example**: 
  ```css  
  .navigation-bar { background-color: #fff; }

* **Practice**: 
  * Use all lowercase letters. 
  * Separate words with hyphens.
  * Useful for names that will appear in URLs or files that should not be case-sensitive.


### 4\. **Pascal Case** (`MyVariableName`) 
* **Best Use**: 
  * Class and interface names in object-oriented programming (C#, Java, TypeScript). 
* **Example**: 
  ```csharp  
  class ShoppingCart { private int totalPrice; } 
* **Practice**: 
  * Start each word with an uppercase letter.
  * Avoid abbreviations and ensure clarity (`CustomerRepository` instead of `CustRepo`).






# Discussion:
Naming conventions in programming are guidelines that help developers choose clear and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities in their code. These conventions improve readability and maintainability by ensuring that names are descriptive and self-explanatory. By following these conventions, developers can reduce errors, make their code easier to understand, and facilitate smoother collaboration and maintenance.

# Experiment no: 03
# Experiment name:
Basic git commnands
# Objective:
* Understanding the commands for git operations and use of it.
# Source code and output:
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `git init` | Initializes a Git repository in the current directory. |
| `git add [file-name.txt]` | Adds a file to the staging area, preparing it for a commit. |
| `git commit -m "commit_message"` | Commits the staged changes to the repository with a message. |
| `git clone [address]` | Creates a local copy of a remote repository. |
| `git status` | Checks the status of files in the working directory and staging area. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to the local repository. |
| `git branch` | Lists all branches, with `*` indicating the current branch. |
| `git branch -a` | Lists all branches, including local and remote branches. |
| `git branch [branch_name]` | Creates a new branch with the specified name. |
| `git branch -d [branch_name]` | Deletes the specified branch locally. |
| `git push origin --delete [branch_name]` | Deletes the specified branch from the remote repository. |
| `git merge [branch_name]` | Merges the specified branch into the current active branch. |
| `git merge [source_branch] [target_branch]` | Merges the source branch into the target branch. |
| `git push origin [branch_name]` | Pushes the specified branch to the remote repository. |
| `git push -u origin [branch_name]` | Pushes changes to the remote repository and sets it as the upstream branch. |
| `git push origin --delete [branch_name]` | Deletes the specified branch from the remote repository. |
| `git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git` | Adds a remote repository to the current project. |
| `git log` | Shows the commit history of the repository. |
# Discussion:
Git is a version control system that helps to track changes in our code and collaborate with others. GitHub is a platform that hosts our Git repositories online, making it easier to share and work on projects with others. We use Git on our local machine to manage our code, and then push our changes to GitHub to collaborate and keep everything in sync.
